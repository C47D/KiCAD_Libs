# KiCAD Personal Libraries, Footprints, 3D Models

Personal KiCAD Libs, Footprints and 3D Models, so if you want to use them do it with caution.

Libraries are on Libs directory (obviously), and so on.

Most of the 3D Models are not mine, most of them i found them online here:

http://elektroquark.com/

or the KiCAD default models.

See Wiki page for the complete list of libraries and footprints.
